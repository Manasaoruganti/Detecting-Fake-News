# Detecting-Fake-News
This project will help you detect fake news using Python. It will use a TfidfVectorizer to convert a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features, and a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to classify the news as real or fake. The dataset used for this project is news.csv, which has a shape of 7796Ã—4. The first column identifies the news, the second and third are the title and text, and the fourth column has labels denoting whether the news is REAL or FAKE. The project will also discuss the terms fake news, tfidfvectorizer, and PassiveAggressiveClassifier.
